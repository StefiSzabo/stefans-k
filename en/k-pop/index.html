                <h3>K-Pop terms that you will hear a lot</h3>

                <p>1. K-Pop Stans</p>
                <p>
                    The word stan is a portmanteau of stalker and fan, and it originated from the 2000 song "Stan" by Eminem,
                    <br>which tells the story of an obsessed fan who writes letters to his idol and eventually kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend.
                    <br>The word stan has been since adopted by various fandoms to describe faans who are extremely devoted, passionate, and sometimes obsessive about their faavorite celebrities or groups.
                    <br>They are fans who follow and support one or more K-Pop artists or groups, often on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram or YouTube.
                    <br>K-Pop Stans are known for their ability to mobilize and coordinate online campaigns, such as streaming songs and videos, voting for awards, trending hashtags, or sabotaging opponents.
                    <br>They are also involved in various social and political causes, such as supporting the Black Lives matter movement, disrupting white supremacist hashtags, or pranking Donald Trump's rally.
                    <br>However, some K-Pop stans may also engage in toxic or problematic behaviors, such as cyberbullying, harassment, or fan wars with other fandoms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note: I'm not a K-Pop Stan and will never be, but this doesn't mean that I don't like a group more than the others.
                    <br>My favorite group is Billlie because of their horror themed songs and lore, and also there is a member that I like, but this doesn't mean that I don't listen to songs of other artists.
                    <br>Yes, I do follow just them on Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and I'm in their fandom (Billlie've) on Weverse, but I will never do what K-Pop Stans do, trust me.
                </p>

                <p>2. Kpoppers</p>
                <p>
                    The word kpopper is a combination of K-Pop and popper, which is a slang term for a person who likes pop music.
                    <br>Kpoppers are fans who enjoy listening to K-Pop music and appreciate the diversity and quality of the genre.
                    <br>They may not be as invested or involved in the fandom activities as K-Pop Stans, but they still respect and support the artists and groups they like.
                    <br>Kpoppers may also be more open-minded and tolerant of different opinions and preferences than some K-Pop Stans.
                    <br>They may like one or more K-Pop artists or groups, or they may like K-pop music in general.
