                <p>
                    The word stan is a portmanteau of stalker and fan, and it originated from the 2000 song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gOMhN-hfMtY&pp=ygULc3RhbiBlbWluZW0%3D" target="_blank" class="underlined-a">"Stan" by Eminem</a>,
                    <br>which tells the story of an obsessed fan who writes letters to his idol and eventually kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend.
                    <br>The word Stan has been since adopted by various <a href="#The-fandoms" class="underlined-a">fandoms</a> to describe fans who are extremely devoted, passionate, and sometimes obsessive about their favorite celebrities or groups.
                    <br>They are fans who follow and support one or more K-Pop artists or groups, often on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram or YouTube.
                    <br>K-Pop Stans are known for their ability to mobilize and coordinate online campaigns, such as streaming songs and videos, voting for awards, trending hashtags, or sabotaging opponents.
                    <br>They are also involved in various social and political causes, such as supporting the Black Lives matter movement, disrupting white supremacist hashtags, or pranking Donald Trump's rally.
                    <br>However, some K-Pop Stans may also engage in toxic or problematic behaviors, such as cyberbullying, harassment, or fan wars with other fandoms.

                    Note: I'm not a K-Pop Stan and will never be, but this doesn't mean that I don't like a group more than the others.
                    <br>My favorite group is <a href="groups and solo-ists/billlie" class="underlined-a">Billlie</a> because of their horror themed songs and lore, and also there is a member that I like, but this doesn't mean that I don't listen to songs of other artists.

                <p id="The-KBS">7. The KBS</p>
                <p>
                    The Korean Beauty Standard, also named KBS, is a set of aesthetic preferences and expectations that are widely shared and promoted in South Korea and beyond.
                    <br>It is influenced by various factors, such as historical, cultural, social, and media influences.
                    <br>It is often considered to be strict and demanding, as it requires a high level of maintenance and conformity.
                    <br>Here are some of the main aspects of it:
                </p>

                <p>● Skin</p>
                <p>
                    The KBS values having fair, smooth, and flawless skin.
                    <br>This is seen as a sign of health, youth, and purity.
                    <br>Koreans spend a lot of time and money on skincare products and routines, such as the famous 10-step skincare regimen.
                    <br>They also avoid sun exposure and use sunscreen, whitening creams, or even skin bleaching treatments to achieve a lighter complexion.
                </p>

                <p>● Eyes</p>
                <p>
                    The KBS favors having large, round, and bright eyes.
                    <br>This is seen as a sign of attractiveness, innocence, and charm.
                    <br>Koreans often use makeup, such as eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, and false eyelashes, to enhance their eyes size and shape.
                    <br>They also use contact lenses to change their eyes color or create a doll-like effect.
                    <br>Many Koreans also undergo double eyelid surgery, which is the most common cosmetic procedure in South Korea, to create a crease in their upper eyelids.
                </p>

                <p>● Face</p>
                <p>
                    The KBS emphasizes having a small, v-shaped face with a pointy nose, plump lips, and straight eyebrows.
                    <br>This is seen as a sign of femininity, cuteness, and elegance.
                </p>

                <p>● Body</p>
                <p>
                    Koreans often follow strict diets and exercise regimes to maintain or lose weight.
                    <br>They also wear clothes that accentuate their body proportions or create an optical illusion of being taller or thinner.
                    <br>Some Koreans also undergo body contouring surgeries, such as liposuction or breast augmentation, to improve their body shape or size.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The KBS is not only applied to women but also to men.
                    <br>Some of the common features that are considered attractive for men are fair skin, double eyelids, high nose bridge, defined jawline, broad shoulders, muscular arms, and abs.
                    <br>However, the KBS is not universally accepted or followed by all Koreans or foreigners.
                    <br>Some people may have different preferences or opinions  on what constitutes beauty.
                    <br>Some people may also challenge or criticize the KBS for being unrealistic, oppressive, or harmful to one's physical and mental health.
                    <br>Therefore, it is important to respect and appreciate the diversity and individuality of beauty in different cultures and societies.

                <p>
                    This generation is more like a term that some media outlets and fans use to describe the current wave of new idol groups that debuted after 2019.
                    <br>These groups are characterized by their experimentation and innovation in music styles and genres, their diversity and global appeal,
