                <p>
                    Many people understand Marketing as the promotion and advertising of products and services, which is not correct, but also not wrong.
                    <br>Marketing is more than that, it is an extensive process of analyzing a company's customers, the market and the environment in which it operates.
                    <br>It is the process of creating, delivering and exchanging value for customers, clients, partners and society at large.
                    <br>It involves understanding the customer needs and wants, developing products or services that satisfy those needs and wants,
                    <br>communicating the value proposition of those products or services and distributing them to the target market.
                    <br>
                    <br>Marketing includes all those actions of selling, promoting, attracting and mantaining customers, demand, how products and services are offered,
                    <br>connecting the company in relation to the market in which it is located, defining the clientele, analyzing the behavior of consumers and customers, the connection of the company with her clients.
                    <br>Marketing also involves managing customer relationships and measuring the effectiveness of Marketing activities.
                    <br>
                    <br>Marketing is said to be the voice of the customer to the company, but also the voice of the company to the customers and the market. It is also called art.
                    <br>The Marketing department works directly with the Sales department and sometimes it is the one and the same department.

            <article id="Marketing-vs-Marketing-Digital" data-clarity-region="article">

                <h3 title="Marketing vs Marketing Digital">Marketing vs Digital Marketing</h3>

                <p>Some of the main differences between Marketing and Digital Marketing are:</p>
                    
                <h4>1. Offline and Online</h4>

                <p>
                    Traditional Marketing includes offline activities, such as print, radio and TV.
                    <br>Digital Marketing is focused on online and digital activities, such as e-mail, social media, advertising and multimedia messaging.
                </p>

                <h4>2. The audience</h4>

                <p>
                    Marketing can reach a broad and diverse audience, but it can be difficult to target specific segments and measure the impact.
                    <br>Digital Marketing can reach a niche and targeted audience, but it can be challenging to stand out from the competition and attract attention.
                </p>

                <h4>3. The techniques</h4>

                <p>
                    Marketing can rely on traditional and established techniques, such as the 4 P's (Product, Price, Place and Promotion)
                    <br>Digital Marketing, besides those, can require inovative and experimental techniques, such as the 4 C's (Consumer, Cost, Convenience and Communication)
                </p>

                <h4>4. The approach</h4>

                <p>
                    Marketing can have a long-term and strategic approach, such as building brand awarreness and loyalty.
                    <br>Digital Marketing can have a short-term and tactical approach, such as generating leads and conversions.
